The thickness of the slabs for the Pakal Dul dam considers the latest ICOLD recommendations based on the height of the dam, analyzing the stresses to determine the final thickness, and taking into consideration the functionality of the element as well as the economy of the project. The safety factor for design under static conditions for the resistance of reinforced concrete is not less than 2,0 (this criterion was verified as shown in Annex 1.1 in the section \"resistance of reinforced concrete stress validation\"). Likewise, the minimum safety factor for design under seismic loading, as explained in the Design Criteria in Section 3.1.1 Seismic design scenario, is at least 1,1.\n",

Reinforcement ratios lower than 0,25% shall not be used in order to control shrinkage and temperature cracking.

The model considers nonlinear stress-strain curves, with softening over and above the peak for both tension and compression, following the Guidelines for Nonlinear Finite Element Analysis of Concrete Structures (2017). Furthermore, the model considers the reinforcement directly by means of embedding layers, with a yield strength of 500 MPa, and no hardening past this point.\n",
