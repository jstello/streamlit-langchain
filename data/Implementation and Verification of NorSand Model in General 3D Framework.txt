ABSTRACT
NorSand is a critical state (plasticity) model for soils in which particle to particle interactions
are controlled by contact forces and slips. The state parameter allows capturing soil behavior
over a wide range of confining stresses and densities using relatively few and familiar soil
properties that can be determined from the routine laboratory or in situ tests. This paper presents
the implementation of NorSand in the leading geotechnical software platform FLAC3D. This
implemented version includes the usual three-dimensional aspects allowing for the proportion of
intermediate principal stress as well as the far less common feature of principal stress rotation;
these aspects allow simulation of cyclic mobility as well as static liquefaction. The results are
cross-verified with a VBA-coded spreadsheet for simulations of various densities, drainage
conditions, and test types, including triaxial compression and simple shear.
INTRODUCTION
Many geotechnical failures cannot be predicted by simple constitutive models for soils,
including the typical brittle strength-loss (static liquefaction) of a loose soil structure being oversurcharged, slope-steepened, or subject to rising pore pressure. The importance of modern
computational soil mechanics has become evident in the past few years where only this approach
was able to show how and why two very large dam failures developed, i.e., the failures of
Fundao (Morgenstern et al. 2016) and Cadia (Morgenstern et al. 2019). But this presents a
challenge for geotechnical engineers, as commercial software has lagged in offering appropriate
constitutive models for liquefaction (however it is caused); the cited failure investigations
adopted a user-defined model that involved specialist skills rarely found in geotechnical practice.
Clearly, much can be gained by making these modern approaches to soil behavior more
accessible to geotechnical practice.
Critical State Soil Mechanics (CSSM) originated in a response of the Corps of Engineers to
avoid rather frequent failures of hydraulic fill dams pre-1920. CSSM fits within the theory of
work hardening plasticity, a thread on soil behavior developing over some 100 years with
contributions from many workers. CSSM has become essentially a mature understanding;
Jefferies and Been (2016) provide a history of the stages in the development of CSSM. CSSM
offers: 1) a natural response to the effect of changes in confining stress and void ratio on soil
behavior through the state parameter; and 2) soil properties that are both familiar and unaffected
by stress level or soil density. There are several “flavors” of CSSM; the variant used here is the
NorSand model, which is a strict implementation of Drucker et al. (1957). The original
“fundamental” derivations are found in Jefferies (1993) with the generalization in Jefferies and
Shuttle (2002). Despite its name, NorSand can be used for all soils as particle to particle
interactions that are controlled by contact forces and slips rather than bonds. The theory has no
concept of “geology”; NorSand was used to represent loose silt liquefaction for both Fundao and
Cadia analyses.

was adopted for the analysis of the Fundao and Cadia failures. NorSand was used as a userdefined model in these analyses, which is less than optimal in terms of speed and convenience.
The upcoming release of FLAC (Itasca 2019a) version 8.1 and FLAC3D (Itasca 2019b) version
7.0 now include NorSand as a built-in soil model. Full benefits of FLAC, including fluidmechanical coupling and large-strain mode with updating of the grid applies to the implemented
NorSand model. Here we describe the implementation of NorSand in FLAC3D, including
features such as principal stress rotation. Verifications and illustration examples are presented.
FORMULATIONS
Both stress and strain are assumed positive in tension and negative for compression
following the convention of the software platform. Pressures (e.g., mean pressure, pore pressure)
are assumed positive in compression. If not explicitly stated otherwise, the stresses and material
properties are “effective” by default. The superscripts e and p denote the elastic and plastic
parts, respectively.
Elasticity: In this implementation version, the elasticity assumes the elastic shear G and
bulk modulus K are

respectively, where p is the current mean pressure, pref is a reference pressure (usually and by
default, 100 kPa), Gref is the reference shear modulus at the reference pressure, m is a material
constant with a physical range of 0 1   m , and v is the Poisson’s ratio, which is considered a
material constant. For m  0, G G  ref , which corresponds to a constant elastic shear modulus.
For m 1, G G p p I p    ref ref r /  , which corresponds to an elastic shear modulus being linear
to the current p with a constant shear rigidity I G p p ref ref  / .
Critical State and Image State: The critical state requires Dp  0 and D e p p / 0 q  , where
the dilatancy D p is defined as D e e p p p  v q / with evp and eqp being the rate of the plastic
volumetric and deviatoric strain, respectively. If only Dp  0, then this is an image state
(denoted by the subscript i ), variously also referred to as the pseudo steady state or phase change
condition. The critical state locus (CSL) can be the traditional one defined by a two-parameter
semi-logarithmic form:
e p ln p c       (2)
where Γ and  are material constants, with p being the mean effective stress. However, many
soils are not well represented by Equation (2) and a power-law form is popular in such instances:

or (3) at the current pressure p :

input as a positive value.

IMPLMENTATION
FLAC3D uses the elastic predictor – plastic corrector (EP-PC) method for plasticity. The
strain increment is additively decomposed into elastic and plastic parts with both plastic and
elastic principal strain increments assumed coaxial with the current principal stress. The
associated flow rule is adopted for plastic evolution. By rearranging the yield function in
Equation (5) into F q Mp M p p p     i i ln / 0   , we have

where s is the plastic multiplier, which will be determined from the consistency condition.
Note that in Equation (11),    F q / 1,      F p D M / p i  , and the associated plastic flow
rule ( e F ij ij      s / ) are used.

In numerical implementation, the last term involving Mi is a tad tedious and loses generality as
it depends on the chosen idealization for the critical state function. The Mi term also varies in
the π-plane as the Lode angle changes. It is both conceptual and practical that, because the last
term on
Mi in Equation (12) changes quite slowly compared with other terms, Mi is updated

only at the end of rather than during plastic correction. In other words, Mi is updated one step
behind the corresponding calculation. In an explicit code like FLAC3D, this error is small
because the steps are small. Equation (12) can thus be rewritten as

by noting that     F p M p p / / i i i . Combining Equations (8), (11), and (13), s can be
numerically solved. Once s is known, the converged principal stress increments can be
calculated (Jefferies et al. 2015).
The NorSand model is a stress-dependent model. Reasonable initial stress should be input the
first time the NorSand model is assigned. The initial conditions include the initial stress, ij, 0 ,
initial state, e0 or 0 , and over-consolidation ratio, OCR p p  i i OCR / ,  1  , which is defined in this
model as the ratio of the current
pi over the calculated pi OCR ,  1  so that the initial stress is on the
“virtual” yield surface corresponding to pi OCR ,  1  . The initial stress invariants, p0 , q0 and the
initial Lode’s angle, 0 , can be calculated from the initial stress. The determination of the initial
image stress pi, 0 and the stress ratio at the image stress, Mi, 0 , needs an iteration procedure.
VERIFICATIONS
Verification checks that the model implementation is mathematically correct and coded
correctly. Model verification requires the simulated results to be compared with closed-form
solutions or with different codes developed independently. The NorSand model does not have
any closed-form solution, so the results simulated at the element level by FLAC3D are compared
with results from direct Euler integration coded in VBA using an Excel spreadsheet for triaxial
compression and simple shear.

drained and undrained tests with the consolidated stress at 100 kPa. Two cases with different
initial state parameters are considered to represent sands at dense (0  0.05 ) and loose (
0  0.05) conditions, respectively. The material properties are listed in Table 1. Figure 2 plots
the results of simulation by FLAC3D and VBA for drained triaxial compression tests for sands
with
ψ 0.05 0   and 0  0.05, respectively. Very close results are found for both the shear
hardening of dense sand and shear softening of loose sand. Figure 3 plots the results for
undrained conditions. The dilative behavior for the dense sand and the contractive behavior for
the loose sand are observed, with excellent agreement between FLAC3D and VBA.

Simple Shear: The NorSand model is used to simulate the undrained simple shear tests with
the initial effective vertical stress of 100 kPa and
K0  0.5. Again, two cases with different
initial state parameters are considered: 0  0.05 representing a loose sand and 0  0.05
representing a dense sand. The material properties are the same as those listed in Table 1. Figure
4 plots the results of simulation by FLAC3D and VBA for undrained simple shear tests. Again,
the agreement between FLAC3D and VBA is good.

softening. The material properties are listed in Table 2. Note that in these tests, the stateparameter-dependent hardening modulus ( H y  0 ) and nonlinear stress dependent elastic shear
modulus ( m 1) are adopted. The initial state parameter is 0  0.1. Also, a slightly overconsolidated ratio (OCR = 1.1) is used, as that is often encountered with test data (presumed to
be a consequence of common sample preparation protocols). Figure 5 plots the results of
simulation by FLAC3D and VBA with and without the additional softening term by setting S =
0 or 1. It is observed that with the softening term, the rate of strength loss with strain is more
rapid. The results between FLAC3D and VBA match very well.

SIMULATION EXAMPLES
Undrained Cyclic DSS Loading: The NorSand model is used to simulate the undrained
direct simple shear (DSS) test with the initial effective vertical stress of 100 kPa and K0  0.9.
The initial state parameter is 0  0.07 . The material properties are listed in Table 3. Note that
in this test, the critical state line is defined by the three-parameter equation as in Equation (13)
since
C 0 c  . The simple shear cyclic magnitude is max = kPa, which corresponds to CSR = 0.1,
where CSR represents cyclic stress ratio. The effect of PSR is activated by setting a non-zero
material parameter Z 12 . Figure 6 plots the results of simulated results by FLAC3D compared
with the measured laboratory data on Fraser River Sand (Sriskandakumar 2004), including
curves of shear stress vs. effective vertical stress, shear stress vs. shear strain, Ru (defined as

Strain Localization: A relatively more complicated boundary-value problem simulation is
illustrated in Figure 7. This is a plain-strain biaxial loading exercise with a grid with dimensions
of 50×50 in the plane. The left side and the base are roller boundaries, the right side is subjected
to a constant pressure of 100 kPa, and a fixed velocity boundary (with vertical strain rate of 1e-6)
is applied at the top surface. The same material properties listed in Table 1 are used. The initial
state parameter for all zones are 0  0.05 and the stress in the model is isotopically initialized
to 100 kPa. The loading continues until the vertical displacement ∆L is 10% of the model
dimension L. Apparent strain localization (shear band) is observed due to the bifurcation of stress

paths. The state parameters in the “shear bands” become positive (dilative status) compared to
initially negative values. The reactive pressure p at the model top surface versus ∆L/L is plotted
in Figure 7, where the global softening is well captured. This example demonstrates the
robustness of the implemented NorSand model.
SUMMARY
The updated NorSand model (as per Jefferies et al. 2015) incorporating the general 3D
formulation with optional softening and principle stress rotation has been implemented in the
widely used software package FLAC3D. The implementation is verified and validated by a wide
range of tests with conditions including loose and dense soils, undrained and drained, triaxial
compression and simple shear, and monotonic and cyclic loading. More complicated case studies
are not included due to the length limit but hopefully will be presented elsewhere. This work
provides a tool for practicing engineers to perform comprehensive analysis, including analysis of
static liquefaction for important soil structures like tailing dams using a constitutive model with
only a few familiar material properties.
