It consists of cushion, transition, main rockﬁll, and\\n\\nsecondary rockﬁll zones (cid:1)see Fig. 1(cid:2). Due to the advantages of\\n\\nCFRDs, including the use of local materials, cost-effectiveness,\\n\\nextensive adaptability, simple construction, and a short construc-\\n\\ntion period, many concrete-faced rockﬁll dams have been and are\\n\\nbeing constructed, some being as high as 100 m. Weak rocks are\\n\\npotential sources of dam construction materials because they\\n\\ncover more than 50% of the Earth’s surface. A number of CFRDs\\n\\nhave been constructed with weak rocks, for example, weak rocks\\n\\nwere used in the main body of the Cirata Dam and the Salvajina\\n\\nDam (cid:1)Pinkerton et al. 1985; Sierra et al. 1985(cid:2); in the dry zones of\\n\\nthe low part of the Winneke Dam, the Mangrove Dam, and the\\n\\nZhushuqiao Dam (cid:1)Casinader and Watt 1985; Mackenzie and\\n\\nMcDonald 1985; Guo 1991(cid:2); and in the middle part of the R. D.\\n\\nBailey Dam (cid:1)Beene and Pritchett 1985(cid:2). Nevertheless, the behav-\\n\\niors of CFRDs constructed with weak rocks are not well-\\n\\nunderstood as explained in the next section. Extensive studies are\\n\\nneeded in order to fully utilize the weak rocks as construction\\n\\nmaterials in CFRDs.\\n\\n1Dept. of Geotechnical Engineering, Tongji Univ., Shanghai 200092,\\n\\nChina; formerly, College of Civil Engineering, Zhejiang Univ., Hangzhou\\n\\n310027, China.

The objective of this study is to examine the\\n\\nproperties of weak rocks, such as physical, mechanical, and hy-\\n\\ndraulic properties, thereby to ﬁnd feasible ways to deal with the\\n\\nproblems encountered during construction. This paper presents\\n\\nthe studies on the weak rocks used in three dams at Yutiao, Da’ao,\\n\\nand Qiezishan in China. Slightly weathered sandy mudstone,\\n\\nweathered sandstone, and weathered granite, respectively, were\\n\\nused to construct these dams. Laboratory and ﬁeld tests were\\n\\nconducted to determine their physical, mechanical, and hydraulic\\n\\nproperties, the quality of placement, and the density of the com-\\n\\npacted rocks. Stability analyses of these dams using Bishop’s\\n\\nslice method were performed. Settlements were evaluated using\\n\\n(cid:1)Duncan and Chang 1970(cid:2).

Comparisons\\n\\nof the constrained modulus of compressibility of the weak rocks\\n\\nfor Da’ao and Yutiao Dams and other dams are given in Table 2.\\n\\nStrength and Stress-Strain Behavior\\n\\nCompared with hard rocks, weak rocks deform more easily (cid:1)Jiang\\n\\nand Fu 1997; Liu and Lin 2001(cid:2). The unconﬁned compressive\\n\\nstrengths of the weak rocks under a saturated condition deter-\\n\\nmined for three dams range from 15 to 30 MPa. Their magnitudes\\n\\nwere inﬂuenced by environmental factors, such as sunlight expo-\\n\\nsure and rainfall. The strengths of the weak rocks are lower than\\n\\nthose of the hard rocks. Both weak rocks and hard rocks are\\n\\nof weathered sandstone, conglomerate, and siltstone. There were\\n\\nfour sets of joints at the dam site, and the inclinations of the joints\\n\\nwere over 70°. The number of the joints was 1 – 3 per m and the\\n\\nlengths were 3 – 5 m. The rock at Qiezishan was weathered coarse\\n\\ngranite with a speciﬁc gravity of 2.65.\\n\\nProperties of Weak Rocks\\n\\nParticle Gradation\\n\\nWeak rocks can be easily crushed into smaller particles when\\n\\ncompacted. Therefore their gradation varies during the construc-\\n\\nthe largest particle size of the quarried\\n\\ntion. For example,\\n\\nthe R. D. Bailey Dam (cid:1)Beene and Pritchett\\n\\nweak rock at\\n\\n1985(cid:2) was 813 mm. After compaction, the largest particle size\\n\\ndecreased to 229 mm,\\n\\nthe median diameters changed from\\n\\n127– 203 to 6 – 9 mm, and the amount of the particles smaller\\n\\nthan 5 mm was about 40%.\\n\\nThe effect of direct crushing by roller compaction was inves-\\n\\ntigated in this research. In addition, the wetting effects on the\\n\\nbreakdown of weak rocks at the Yutiao and Da’ao Dams were\\n\\ninvestigated through the wet-dry tests. To examine the change of\\n\\nparticle gradation, weak rock samples collected from the quarries\\n\\nwere sieved ﬁrst and then resieved after two wet-dry cycles. The\\n\\nchanges of particle gradation after the wet-dry cycles are given in\\n\\nTable 1. Wetting effect causes the breakdown of weak rocks and\\n\\nincreases the percentage of the particle size smaller than 5 mm.\\n\\nParticle breakdowns of the weak rocks at the Yutiao Dam were\\n\\nmore obvious than those at the Da’ao Dam.\\n\\nDensity and Compressibility\\n\\nWeak rocks are easily compacted to a high density due to break-\\n\\ndown of particles. The compacted weak rocks at the Yutiao Dam\\n\\nreached a maximum dry density of 2,280 kg/ m3 at the optimum\\n\\nmoisture content of 6% using the standard Proctor compaction\\n\\nTable 2.

Fig. 2 shows the stress-strain relation-\\n\\nships of the weak rocks at Yutiao and Da’ao Dams.\\n\\nField Tests of Projects\\n\\nPermeability and Deformation on Wetting\\n\\nAfter compaction, the permeability of weak rocks can be signiﬁ-\\n\\ncantly reduced. For example, the weak rocks of R. D. Bailey Dam\\n\\n(cid:1)Beene and Pritchett 1985(cid:2) were relatively impervious after com-\\n\\npaction. The measured permeability after compaction was about\\n\\n10−3 – 10−5 m / s at Shisanling Dam (cid:1)Dai 1994(cid:2), 10−4 – 10−5 m / s at\\n\\nTianshengqiao1 Dam (cid:1)Bai and Huang 2000(cid:2), and 10−4 – 10−6 m / s\\n\\nat Mangrove Dam (cid:1)Mackenzie and McDonald 1985(cid:2). The perme-\\n\\nability of weak rocks depends on both the dry unit density and the\\n\\nsmall particle (cid:1)(cid:1)5 mm(cid:2) content. Field permeability tests, both\\n\\nvertically and horizontally, were conducted at Da’ao Dam and\\n\\nYutiao Dam. The setup of the horizontal permeability test is\\n\\nshown in Fig. 3. The vertical permeability test followed the pro-\\n\\ncedures of double-ring, i.e.: (cid:1)1(cid:2) 0.8 m thick weak rock was rolled\\n\\neight passes and then 0.2 m of its top was excavated, (cid:1)2(cid:2) an\\n\\nexternal steel ring (cid:1)diameter 452 mm(cid:2) and an inner steel ring\\n\\n(cid:1)diameter 226 mm(cid:2) were carefully placed at the test pit, (cid:1)3(cid:2) the\\n\\ninner steel ring and the gap of the external and inner steel rings\\n\\nwere ﬁlled with pure water, and (cid:1)4(cid:2) the test instrument was in-\\n\\nstalled. The measured horizontal and vertical permeability values\\n\\nare provided in Table 3.\\n\\nEffect of Saturation\\n\\nSaturation of weak rocks can reduce their strength. The reduction\\n\\nof strength can be represented by a softening coefﬁcient, ex-\\n\\npressed as the ratio of compressive strength at saturation to that at\\n\\nthe dry condition. The volume of weak rocks may decrease when\\n\\nsoaked; this volume change is called the wet-deformation. The\\n\\ndeformations of the compacted weak rocks at Da’ao Dam and\\n\\nTable 3.

A\\n\\n2.18 m vibrating roller with a mass of 16,000 kg was used for\\n\\ncompaction. The layout of the ﬁrst test site is shown in Fig. 4. In\\n\\norder to observe the compaction, eight survey points were set up\\n\\nin every test panel. The symbols of A1–F3 represent the test panel\\n\\nnumber. Three layers were tested: the ﬁrst two layers were mud-\\n\\nstone with a thickness of 0.6 and 0.8 m; the third layer was a\\n\\nmixture of 60% mudstone and 40% argillaceous sandstone with\\n\\na thickness of 1.0 m.

The compaction\\n\\nratio is deﬁned as the ratio of the compression of the layer to its\\n\\noriginal thickness.\\n\\nIn order to study crushing and crusting of weak rocks, sprin-\\n\\nkling tests of the weak rocks and permeability tests of the crusting\\n\\nlayer were carried out. Sprinkling tests were performed by adding\\n\\na certain amount of water to the weak rocks during the placement\\n\\nto achieve a speciﬁc water content and then testing its effect on\\n\\nthe properties of the weak rocks. The results of the sprinkling\\n\\ntests are listed in Table 6. In addition, specimens were taken from\\n\\nthe crusting layers to acquire the distribution of particles smaller\\n\\nthan 5 mm. Tables 7 and 8 show the results of the sieve analysis\\n\\nand the permeability tests of the crust, respectively. The vertical\\n\\npermeability of the crusting layer was low and the thickness of\\n\\nthe crusting layer after compaction was about 0.1 m.\\n\\nPlacement Tests of Weak Rocks at Da’ao Dam\\n\\nThe weathered sandstone was used as the test material at Da’ao\\n\\nDam. The measured average unconﬁned compressive strength of\\n\\nthis weathered sandstone at saturation was 28 MPa. A vibrating\\n\\nroller with a mass of 13,500 kg was used for ﬁve series of rolling\\n\\ncompaction tests. The initial\\n\\nthicknesses ranged from\\n\\n0.8 to 1.0 m with the average layer thickness of 0.93 m. After\\n\\nevery two passes of rolling, the compression was measured and\\n\\nthe specimens were sampled for tests. The average values of the\\n\\nrolling compaction test results are shown in Table 9. When the\\n\\nlayer\\n\\nrolling compaction was over, the maximum particle size was de-\\n\\ntermined at 580 mm and the average particle size was 90 mm.\\n\\nThe coefﬁcients of uniformity and curvature were 58.9 and 9.7,\\n\\nrespectively.\\n\\nPlacement Tests of Weak Rocks at Qiezishan Dam\\n\\nThe measured unconﬁned compressive strength of the weak rock\\n\\nat saturation was 20– 30 MPa. The area of the test ﬁeld was\\n\\n15 m (cid:2) 30 m. Two initial thicknesses of the two layers were 0.88\\n\\nand 1.27 m, respectively. The rockﬁll was sprinkled with water to\\n\\nachieve a water content of 10–15% and then compacted with a\\n\\nvibrating roller with a mass of 17,000 kg. Sieve analysis showed\\n\\nthat the percent of the medium size particles (cid:1)5 – 80 mm(cid:2) was less\\n\\nthan 25% and small particle (cid:1)(cid:1)5 mm(cid:2) contents were high after\\n\\ncompaction. The densities of rockﬁll at the two test locations\\n\\nwere both greater than 2,000 kg/ m3 after compaction.\\n\\nIn order to further study the crushing and crusting properties of\\n\\nthe weak rocks, the sprinkling tests of the weak rocks and the\\n\\npermeability tests of the crusting layer were carried out with\\n\\nheavily weathered materials and the materials left in the process\\n\\nof construction. The test results of the weathered materials\\n\\nshowed that the coefﬁcient of the vertical permeability was in the\\n\\norder of 10−7 m / s. Rolling compaction apparently crushed the\\n\\nparticles near the surface and formed a crusting layer with a thick-\\n\\nness of 0.10– 0.20 m.

The water content of the weak rocks was 5% for\\n\\nYutiao Dam and 10% for Qiezishan Dam.\\n\\nIt is important to properly select the thickness of the weak\\n\\nrock for placement in the CFRD. The initial layer thicknesses\\n\\nused in these three dams were 0.8– 1.0 m and the masses of\\n\\nthe rollers were 13,500– 17,000 kg. Under such conditions,\\n\\nthe densities of the weak rocks after compaction met the\\n\\nrequirements of the three projects.\\n\\n4. The rolling compaction of weak rocks would create crust.\\n\\nThe thickness of the crust is less than 0.20 m. Crusting\\n\\nsigniﬁcantly reduces the vertical permeability of weak rock\\n\\nﬁll. The following measures may be taken to deal with the\\n\\ncrusting:\\n\\na.\\n\\nControl\\n\\nplacement of the weak rock;\\n\\nthe gradation of quarry materials during the\\n\\nb. When the thickness of the crust is thinner than 0.1 m, the\\n\\ncrust needs to be overturned and dislocated to enhance its\\n\\nvertical permeability. When the thickness of the crust is\\n\\nthicker than 0.1 m, the crust should be excavated, mixed\\n\\nwith a certain amount of hard rocks, and then recom-\\n\\npacted; and\\n\\nAdding a certain amount of hard rocks can increase the\\n\\npermeability of the crust. Since the thickness of the crust\\n\\nis generally less than 0.2 m, hard rocks should be added\\n\\nonly to the upper part of each placement layer. Hard\\n\\nrocks were used in these three projects with the propor-\\n\\ntion of hard rocks at 60% at Yutiao Dam, 40% at\\n\\nQiezishan Dam, and 25% at Da’ao Dam, respectively.\\n\\nc.\\n\\nStability and Deformation Analysis of Da’ao Dam\\n\\nIn order to ensure good drainage and maintain a relatively dry\\n\\ncondition at the lower zone boundary to reduce the deformation\\n\\nFig. 7.

The\\n\\nstability analysis of these two cases shows that the safety factors\\n\\nagainst circular slip failure are greater than 1.55 and the critical\\n\\nslip surfaces are at shallow depths.\\n\\nTo investigate the effect of the weak rock zone on the stresses\\n\\nand strains of the dam body and the deﬂection of the face slab,\\n\\nfour ﬁnite element analyses of this dam were performed. The\\n\\ncross-sectional areas of the weak rocks for these four analyses are\\n\\nABCH, ABDH, ABEH, and ABFG as shown in Fig. 8. The effect\\n\\nof the location of the weak rock upstream boundary on the\\n\\nstresses and strains in this dam was also studied.\\n\\nThe calculated maximum values of stresses and displacements\\n\\nin the dam are provided in Table 12. The analyses based on these\\n\\nfour models show that the distribution of stresses and displace-\\n\\nments in the dam are almost identical. The maximum settlements\\n\\noccur near the dam axis and at about one-half of the dam height.\\n\\nThe maximum settlements during water storage are 1.07, 1.20,\\n\\n1.23, and 1.31 m, corresponding to 1.18, 1.33, 1.36, and 1.45% of\\n\\nthe dam height, respectively. The settlements of the dam increase\\n\\nwith an increase of the weak rock zone. These settlements are\\n\\nfound to be acceptable to this project. The calculated maximum\\n\\ntensile stress in the face slabs is 0.56 MPa, which is lower than\\n\\nthe allowable tensile strength (cid:1)2.55 MPa(cid:2) of the concrete.\\n\\nField Observations at Da’ao Dam\\n\\nWeak rocks were used at both the main rockﬁll and the secondary\\n\\nrockﬁll zones at Da’ao Dam. Deformations and seepage within\\n\\nDa’ao Dam were monitored. At the crest and downstream slope of\\n\\nthe dam, six collimation lines and 26 surface benchmarks were\\n\\nestablished to observe horizontal displacements and settlements\\n\\nof the dam. At elevations of 161, 178.5, and 191 m, 11 settlement\\n\\ngauges were installed to monitor its internal settlements of the\\n\\ndam and six displacement gauges were installed along the con-\\n\\ncrete slab and the dam axis to monitor the horizontal displace-\\n\\nments.

The measured maximum settlement\\n\\nin the ﬁeld was 0.920 m, which is equal to 1.02% of the dam\\n\\nheight. Most of the deformation occurred during the construction.\\n\\nThe horizontal displacements were nearly symmetric along the\\n\\ndam axis. The maximum horizontal displacement occurred at the\\n\\ndam bottom.\\n\\nThe measured maximum deﬂection of\\n\\nthe face slabs was\\n\\n0.2253 m, which is less than the calculated value of 0.2733 m.\\n\\nThe horizontal strains in the concrete face slabs were all compres-\\n\\nsive. Most of the strains in the slope direction were also compres-\\n\\nsive except at the border and at the corner where the strains were\\n\\ntensile. The observed maximum compressive and tensile strains\\n\\nwere −421.77(cid:2) 10−6 and 61.65(cid:2) 10−6, respectively, which are\\n\\nwithin the acceptable range. No damage of the face slabs by water\\n\\nﬁlling is expected.\\n\\nDisplacement during Water Filling and Storage\\n\\nThe ﬁeld observation showed that the rate of the settlement of the\\n\\ndam depended on the water level during water ﬁlling. The settle-\\n\\nment rate was larger when the water level rose rapidly during the\\n\\nﬁrst 2 months of water ﬁlling. From September 1999 to February\\n\\n2000 the settlement rate decreased as a result of slower rise of the\\n\\nwater level. During the ﬂood season from March to May 2000,\\n\\nthe water level reached 216.66 m (cid:1)the highest elevation ever(cid:2) and\\n\\nthe deformation rate increased again. The settlement of the dam\\n\\nbecame stable within 1 year after the water level had reached a\\n\\nnormal elevation of 208 m. The corresponding maximum settle-\\n\\nment was 0.198 m. The maximum horizontal displacements ob-\\n\\nserved from the inner part and from the surface of the dam were\\n\\n0.110 and 0.121 m, respectively.\\n\\nThe measured maximum total settlement and horizontal dis-\\n\\nplacement during the construction, water ﬁlling, and storage were\\n\\n1.118 and 0.232 m, which are less than the calculated values of\\n\\n1.31 and 0.45 m, respectively.\\n\\nFig. 8. Finite element mesh for analysis of Da’ao Dam\\n\\nSeepage Observations\\n\\nThe measured pore water pressure in Da’ao Dam changed with\\n\\nthe water level. The highest water level within the dam was ob-\\n\\nserved in the cushion of the dam, which was only 0.99– 3.23 m\\n\\nhigher than the water level of the downstream from October 1999\\n\\nto October 2000. In the same period, the water level difference\\n\\nbetween the upstream and downstream was 66– 77 m. This obser-\\n\\nvation showed that the concrete face slab functioned well in wa-\\n\\nterprooﬁng and the dam had a good drainage system. The rate of\\n\\nthe seepage discharge also changed with the water level. The rate\\n\\nof the total seepage discharge prior to January 2000 was slightly\\n\\nhigher than 0.030 m3 / s. The seepage rate increased continuously\\n\\nfrom 0.030 to 0.160 m3 / s with the rising of the water level and\\n\\nthen dropped to 0.061 m3 / s with the lowering of the water level\\n\\nTable 12.

When the rate of the total seepage\\n\\ndischarge reached 0.160 m3 / s, the height of the saturation line in\\n\\nthe dam was only slightly higher than the riverbed.\\n\\nConclusions\\n\\nThe following conclusions may be drawn from this study:\\n\\n1. The unconﬁned compressive strength of the weak rocks in\\n\\nthis study ranges from 15 to 30 MPa, which includes soft\\n\\nand weathered rocks;\\n\\n2. As compared with hard rocks, weak rocks are easily crushed\\n\\nand sensitive to water content variations in addition to their\\n\\nlow permeability. However, they have medium compressibil-\\n\\nity, well-graded particle-size distribution, and easy compac-\\n\\ntion so that they can be used as construction materials in\\n\\nCFRDs;\\n\\n3. The three projects discussed in this paper showed that it is\\n\\ncritical to avoid crushing and crusting of weak rocks and to\\n\\nensure the density of compacted ﬁll during the construction;\\n\\n4. The numerical analyses showed that the deformations of the\\n\\nweak rock dams are larger than those of hard rock dams. The\\n\\nmaximum settlement of the dam increases with the percent-\\n\\nage of the weak rock used in the dam. The upper boundary of\\n\\nthe weak rock zone has a signiﬁcant effect on the deforma-\\n\\ntion of the dam. Both slope stability and deformation analy-\\n\\nses showed that the CFRD performed well by using proper\\n\\nrock materials in different zones; and\\n\\nField monitoring conﬁrmed the performance of CFRDs and\\n\\nthe feasibility of using weak rocks as construction materials\\n\\nfor dams.\\n\\n5.\\n\\nAcknowledgments\\n\\nThis research was sponsored by China Water Resources and Hy-\\n\\ndropower Engineering Corporation.
