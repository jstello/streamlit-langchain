The Miaojiaba CFRD is used as an example, and details about its site conditions, construction materials, staged construction scheme, and monitoring system are provided. The document includes tables, figures, and numerical models to analyze the behavior of the dam, reservoir pressure, and stress and deformation patterns of the cutoff wall. Different construction schemes and their effect on the dam behavior are discussed. The document also provides a list of references related to geotechnical engineering and dam construction."
/content/drive/MyDrive/ICOLD - CFRD New Bulletin 2023/Numerical Analysis/Seismic response analysis of face slabs in concrete face rockfill dams.pdf,Seismic response analysis of face slabs in concrete face rockfill dams,"The document focuses on the interface between the concrete slab and cushion layer in concrete-face rockfill dams (CFRDs). It examines the use of advanced constitutive models to simulate granular soil-structure interfaces and the effects of interface roughness, reservoir water level, and seismic ground motion on the concrete face slab response. Numerical simulations show that under seismic conditions, the concrete face slab in CFRDs experiences significant compressive and tensile stresses, which may lead to serious damage. The document also includes references to various academic papers and publications related to geotechnical engineering topics."

The testing included triaxial tests, impact, crushing, and Los Angeles abrasion tests to determine the behavior of the rockfill materials under applied loading. Disturbed State Concept (DSC) and Hierarchical Single Surface (HISS) with yield function and plastic potential models were used to describe the material behavior, and parameters such as friction angle, hardening function, non-associative parameter, and ultimate parameters were determined from the observed results. Regression analysis was conducted to determine the constants to be used in predicting material parameters for prototypes of rockfill materials. The text concludes with references and sources related to geologic materials and testing methods for engineering materials."
