Eng., Faculty of Civil Eng., Skopje, Republic of Macedonia\\n\\nINTRODUCTION\\n\\nMohale dam is concrete face rockfill dam, with height H=145 m, length of the dam crest 600\\n\\nm and total fill volume of 7.5 millions m3. In the process of reservoir impounding, when the\\n\\nreservoir level reached maximum elevation, significant dam movements occurred, this in turn\\n\\nincreased the compressive stresses within the center portion of the concrete face, resulting\\n\\nin  shear  failure  of  the  slab.  The  main  objective  of  this  analysis  is  to  gain  data  for  the\\n\\ndeformation-stress  state  of  the  dam,  including  and  the  observed  cracking  pattern  of  the\\n\\nconcrete face, using three-dimensional model with simplified topography, incorporation of the\\n\\nconcrete  face  with  use  of  the  dam  zoning  and  construction  sequence.  In  other  words,  the\\n\\nhistory  of  the  behaviour  of  the  structure  (related  to  construction  sequence,  water  level\\n\\nhistories and appearance of the cracking failure), should be followed by means of numerical\\n\\nexperiments. These data would serve for comparison with the measured results that will be\\n\\nfollowed  by  interpretation  of  the  obtained  data  and  in  the  end  conclusions  concerning  the\\n\\nobtained results and the behaviour of the dam.\\n\\nDESCRIPTION OF THE THREE DIMENSIONAL NUMERICAL MODEL OF\\n\\nANALYSIS\\n\\nGENERAL PART\\n\\nThe  used  computer  software  SOFiSTiK  for  stress-strain  analyses,  produced  in  Munich\\n\\n(Germany),  is  based  on  the  finite  element  method.  It  has  a  wide  range  of  possibilities  for\\n\\nsimulation  of  dam  behaviour  and  inclusion  in  the  analyses  of  all  necessary  fenomena,\\n\\nimportant for real simulation of the dam behaviour, such as: an automatic discretization of the\\n\\ndam body taking into account the iregularities in the geometry of the dam base, application of\\n\\ndifferent  constitutive  models  for  materials,  simulation  of  the  dam  body  construction  and\\n\\nreservoir filling in increments, and so on. The program has rich possibilities for presentation\\n\\nof the output results. In our work, mainly plane graphical presentation was used, showing the\\n\\noutput  results  in  the  required  cross  and  longitudinal  sections,  and  also  in  the  required  slab\\n\\nfailure points. On Fig. 1 is shown the general view of the layout of the dam, Fig. 2 shows the\\n\\ntypical cross section of the dam. In Table 1 are given the materials included in the dam body.\\n\\nTable 1.

The rockfill body of\\n\\nthe dam was built of three different materials with similar properties. In the analytical model\\n\\nthey are presented with constitutive material model GRAN from the library of SOFiSTiK. That\\n\\n2\\n\\n10th Benchmark Workshop on Numerical Aspects of dams, Paris, September, 2009\\n\\nis  extended  elastoplastic  material  with  an  optimized  hardening  rule  (single  and  double\\n\\nhardening) for soil materials. Hardening is limited by the material’s strength, represented by\\n\\nthe  classic  Mohr/Coulomb  failure  criterion  (Fig.  3a).  The  hardening  rule  is  based  on  the\\n\\nhyperbolic  stress-strain relationship proposed  by  Kondner/Zelasko,  which  was  derived  from\\n\\ntriaxial testing (Fig. 3b). Additionally, the  model accounts for the stress dependent stiffness\\n\\naccording to equations (1−3). A further essential feature is the model’s ability to capture the\\n\\nloading  state  and  can  therefore  automatically  account  for  the  different  stiffness  in  primary\\n\\nloading and un−/reloading paths.\\n\\nFigure 3. Mohr-Coulomb failure criterion and hyperbolic stress-strain relationship.\\n\\nRockfill  material  shows  stiffness  behaviour  dependent  of  the  stress  state.  The  oedometric\\n\\nmodulus  magnitude  depends  on  the  effective  axial  stress  state  according  to  the  following\\n\\nrelationships, equation (1):\\n\\nE50  is  defined  as  secant  stiffness  that  corresponds  to  a  50−percent  mobilisation  of  the\\n\\nmaximum shear capacity, given by equation (2).\\n\\n(1)\\n\\nAn analogous approach for the elastic un−/reloading stiffness yields, given by equation (3):\\n\\n(2)\\n\\nThe face of the dam was built of the concrete C 25.

The  finite  element  mesh  was  generated  using  SOFiSTiK  automatic  mesh\\n\\ngenerator.  Three  types  of  element  were  used  to  model  the  dam’s  body:  BRIC  and  QUAD\\n\\nelements.  The  body  of  the  rockfill  dam  was  modelled  with  3D  solid  elements  (8th  node\\n\\nissoparametric).The  solid  element  of  SOFiSTiK  is  the  BRIC  (volume)  element  (Fig.  7),  a\\n\\ngeneral six-sided element with eight nodes.\\n\\nFigure 6. General view of the 3-D model of the dam-foundation system.\\n\\n4\\n\\n10th Benchmark Workshop on Numerical Aspects of dams, Paris, September, 2009\\n\\nFigure 7. BRIC element.\\n\\nThe plane element QUAD (shell) (Fig. 8) is a general quadrilateral element with four nodes.\\n\\nThe surfaces of the BRIC element can be described by special QUAD-elements, which can\\n\\nalso  be  employed  for  the  display  of  stresses  in  BRIC-elements.  The  QUAD-elements  are\\n\\nintroduced in order to simplify the process of generation of the water pressure loads.\\n\\nFigure 8. QUAD element.\\n\\nThe  input  data  in  the  analysis  were  the  given data  regarding  the  geometry  of  the  dam  and\\n\\nthe material properties. In order to simulate the construction sequences the body of the dam\\n\\nwas modelled with 18 construction stages (horizontal layers). The concrete face of the dam\\n\\nwas modelled by shell elements. It was applied at the body in two construction stages. The\\n\\nface elements are with variable thickness. The thickness of the concrete was determined as\\n\\na  function  of  the  hydrostatic  pressure,  following  the  equation  e=0.30+0.00H.  Adopted\\n\\nreinforcement  is  0.4%  in  vertical  direction  and  0.35%  in  horizontal  direction.  The  concrete\\n\\nface was built in several strips (15 m width) and joint gaps between the strips were adapted 2\\n\\ncm (Fig. 9). For the needs of the nonlinear analysis the shell element are treated as layered\\n\\nin 10 concrete layers, (Fig. 10). The reinforcement is also simulated by smeared layers.

Simulation of the construction of the shell elements in layers.\\n\\nThe numerical model gives two possibilities for simulation of the supports:\\n\\nSimply support connection where there are no movements in the supported points.\\n\\nSupports  by  linear/nonlinear  bedding.  With  this  type  of  supports  some  effects\\n\\ncharacteristic for soli-structure interaction can be simulated (sliding of the dam body,\\n\\nlifting in the case of the tension, linear/nonlinear friction and similar).\\n\\nThe strips of the concrete face are connected with stiffer foundations. The interface between\\n\\nthese  elements  is  with  edges  hinge  that  allowed  independent  rotation  of  strips  and\\n\\nfoundation along the common edges, but keep the connection between the both.\\n\\nINTERFACE\\n\\nThe  dam  was  build  of  elements  with  very  different  stiffness.  In  order  to  avoid  numerical\\n\\nproblem  during  nonlinear  analyses,  rigid  connection  of  that  type  of  element  should  be\\n\\navoided. The strips faced element initially has gap of 2 cm (Fig. 11). During the construction\\n\\nand impounding, free movement between neighbour points happened till the points contact\\n\\neach other. After that the point moved together without, and some forces can be transferred\\n\\nbetween the points. This type of the interface was simulated with nonlinear spring that cannot\\n\\ntransfer  tension  forces.  The  spring  will  be  activated  in  the  moment  when  the  distance\\n\\nbetween the points became equal to the gap (2 cm).\\n\\nP\\n\\nGAP=2.0 cm\\n\\nCN\\n\\nGAP\\n\\nFigure 11. Spring-force displacement relation.\\n\\nThe  connection  between  the  concrete  strips  and  the  rockfill  body  was  simulated  with\\n\\nnonlinear distributed springs. The characteristics of these springs are as follow (Fig. 12):\\n\\nCN  –  axial  spring  constant.  Usually  very  large  number  to  preserve  contact  between\\n\\nthe strips and the body in the normal direction.\\n\\nCT  –  lateral  spring  constant.  That  constant  can  allow  movement  between  the\\n\\ninterface  surfaces.

In  the  case  CRAC  =  0,  no  tension  between  the  surface  is\\n\\nallowed.\\n\\nGAP  –  the  spring  will  be  activated  when  the  distance  between  the  points  became\\n\\nequal to the gap’s value.\\n\\n6\\n\\n10th Benchmark Workshop on Numerical Aspects of dams, Paris, September, 2009\\n\\nFigure 12. Connection between the concrete strips and the rockfill body.\\n\\nLOADING OF THE DAM\\n\\nAccording  to  the  given  data,  appropriate  loads  from  self  weight  and  water  pressure  were\\n\\ncreated.  SOFiSTiK  has  very  efficient  tools  for  load  generation.  The  self  weight  loads  are\\n\\napplied with the values of the unit weight of the materials in the dam body and division of the\\n\\ndam body in appropriate construction sequences, according to the given data, with command\\n\\nto act in the gravity direction. The simulation of the dam construction in layers is displayed on\\n\\nFig.  13.  The  temperature,  and  the  creep  and  shrinking  effects  were  not  taken  into\\n\\nconsideration.\\n\\nFigure 13. Simulation of dam construction in layers.\\n\\nWith  the  VOLU-statement,  a  loading  on  volumes,  group  of  BRIC-elements  or  all\\n\\nQUAD-elements within the volume is enabled. The changes of the pressure load along tree\\n\\nedges are specified. All referenced elements of the group or the volume will be loaded. The\\n\\nselection  of  elements  is  only  by  a  sheared  cube  (Fig.  14),  defined  by  three  selectable\\n\\ndirections p1−p, p3−p2, p5−p4, which must not be collinear. For transfer of the water pressure\\n\\nloads, some QUAD elements faces on the upstream of the dam’s body was created, that are\\n\\nenabling  to  introduce  the  concrete  face  in  the  analysis  and  to  apply  the  water  load\\n\\nadequately  (Fig.  15  and  16).  This  elements  has  only  geometrical  values,  they  have  no\\n\\ncontribution on the total structure stiffness. Referencing these QUAD elements in the VALU\\n\\nstatement cause simple transfer of the water pressure in appropriate node loads. The water\\n\\nload is applied as hydrostatic pressure in increments.\\n\\n7\\n\\n10th Benchmark Workshop on Numerical Aspects of dams, Paris, September, 2009\\n\\nFigure 14.

It  has  rich  possibilities  for  modeling  of  the  dam  body,  and  also  possibilities  for\\n\\napplication of different constitutive laws, as well as for complex load influences.\\n\\nFrom the analysis of dam behaviour for the loading states (state after dam construction\\n\\nand  state  after  reservoir  impounding),  obtained  values  and  distribution  of  the  dam\\n\\nsettlements  and  vertical  stresses  are  usual  for  this  type  of  dam.  The  maximal  vertical\\n\\nsettlement  is  in  the  intermediate  part  of  the  dam,  located  approximately  at  60%  of  the\\n\\ndam height, with value 2.138 m at point HS B11, while the measured value at the same\\n\\npoint  is  2.32  m.  This  shows  good  accordance  between  these  values.  Maximal  vertical\\n\\nstresses are at the bottom, in the central part of the, with value of 2.36 MPa.\\n\\nFrom the comparison of the measured values for surface settlements for lake level at EL\\n\\n2075  (Fig.  16  from  the  given  data)  and  obtained  values  from  the  analysis  (only  for  the\\n\\nupstream  side,  Fig.  28  from  the  analysis)  it  can  be  noticed  that  the  diagram  and  the\\n\\nvalues of the settlements are very similar and also shows good accordance.\\n\\nUp to now, with calibration of the numerical model, using some of the advanced features\\n\\nof the program SOFiSTiK, it was possible to explain some of the results obtained by the\\n\\nperformed  measurements.  But,  to  explain  the  complete  behaviour  of  the  dam  including\\n\\nthe  crack  pattern,  it  is  necessary  to  do  additional  improvement  and  calibration  of  the\\n\\nalready complex numerical model with the measured data.\\n\\nView publication stats\\n\\n19\\n\\nﬁ\\n\\nﬁ\\n\\nﬁ\\n\\nﬁ', metadata={'source': 'G:\\\\.shortcut-targets-by-id\\\\1vE28d8xZuJXkpcinFbuku9FJgeaDd48K\\\\ICOLD - CFRD New Bulletin 2023\\\\Dam Response\\\\ANALYSISOFACONCRETEFACEROCKFILLDAMINCLUDING.pdf'})"
